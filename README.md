# Movie Genre Recommendation System using Machine Learning
This is a data science capstone project aimed at building a movie genre recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The goal of the project is to recommend movie genres based on their synopsis.

## Problem Statement
The aim of this project is to build a recommendation system that can predict the genre of a movie based on its synopsis. The system will use machine learning techniques to analyze the synopsis of a movie and predict its genre.

## Data Type
The dataset used in this project is an IMDB movie dataset, which includes information such as the movie title, genre, synopsis, cast, director, rating, and poster link.

## Algorithm Used
The following machine learning algorithms were used in this project:

- RandomForestClassifier
- Support Vector Machine Classifier
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

## Data Preprocessing
The data was preprocessed using techniques such as text cleaning, tokenization, and TF-IDF vectorization to prepare it for the machine learning algorithms.

## Training Model
The RandomForestClassifier and Decision Tree Classifier algorithms were trained on the preprocessed data to build the recommendation system. These algorithms were chosen for their ability to handle multi-class classification tasks.

The final output of this project is a recommendation system that can predict the genre of a movie based on its synopsis.
